## Overview

**SSP Relay** is the communication backbone of the **[SSP Wallet](https://sspwallet.io)** ecosystem, enabling seamless interaction between **SSP Wallet** and **SSP Key**. By acting as a secure relay server, it facilitates synchronization, multisignature transaction management, and reliable communication without ever compromising private keys or sensitive data.

### Key Features
- **Secure Communication**: Ensures encrypted and authenticated data transfer between SSP Wallet and SSP Key.
- **Multisignature Support**: Powers the **2-of-2 multisignature architecture**, enhancing the security of user transactions.
- **True Self-Custody**: Operates without storing or accessing private keys, maintaining the user's self-custody.
- **Scalable and Reliable**: Built with modern technologies to handle large-scale usage efficiently.
